<h1>Public Domain Dedication - Bad Confirmation</h1>

<p>
It seems you are trying to confirm your public domain dedication with
an incorrect confirmation code.</p>

<p>
This probably happened because you were not able to click through on
the URL sent in your email, and you copy and pasted the URL
incorrectly into your browser. Make sure to include <b>all
characters</b> from the URL sent to you.

<p>
If this is not what happened, or if you continue to have trouble
confirming your public domain dedication in any way, please <a
