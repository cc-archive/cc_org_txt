The Sampling Flavour determines how much freedom licensees have. Sampling only allows pieces to be used and prohibits sharing of the entire work.  Sampling Plus allows licensees to take and transform pieces of the work, as well as share the entire work for non-commercial purposes.  Noncommercial Sampling Plus further restricts the Sampling Plus license by only authorizing non-commercial adaptations to be created from the pieces of your work.
