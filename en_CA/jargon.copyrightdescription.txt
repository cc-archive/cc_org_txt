Copyright. A set of limited monopoly rights that governments grant to encourage the production of creative works. A copyright includes the rights to copy, distribute, transmit (including broadcast), market, and make adaptations out of a creative work. It also includes the right to sue to enforce these rights, and to authorize others to exercise them. Copyright does not apply to facts or ideas, but to the original expression of those facts or ideas.
